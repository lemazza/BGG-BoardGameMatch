This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder.&#10;&#10;The goal in &quot;Nordic&quot; remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route.&#10;&#10;Unlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play.&#10;&#10;Although not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 &#226;&#128;&#147; United Kingdom & Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 &#226;&#128;&#147; United Kingdom & Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries takes you on a Nordic adventure through Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden as you travel to the great northern cities of Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm.

One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.&#10;&#10;Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Life in the village is hard &ndash; but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please.

Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins.

Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components.

Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis).

In principle, every card can be used for every action &ndash; but the color of the card determines in which areas the actions can be used or the strength of the chosen action, e.g., blue cards provide blue workers and red cards help mitigate red threats. All of the action is geared toward the gathering of prestige, with the most prestigious merchant winning in the end.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Bruges in the 15th century &ndash; culture and commerce flourish and make the Belgian Hanseatic city into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe.&#10;&#10;In Bruges (a.k.a.

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&#10;&#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.&#10;&#10;The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.&#10;&#10;At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a French Plantation Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing.

In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards.

In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded.

Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.&#10;&#10;Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D.

The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.&#10;&#10;Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.&#10;&#10;The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.&#10;&#10;Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Early in the history of the United States, slavery was an institution that seemed unmovable but with efforts of men and women across the country, it was toppled.

There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities.  Each route must consist of at least three cities.  Players may only build one route at a time.  Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card.  The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards.  On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one.  If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it.  The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage.  Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route.  Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered.  Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Jenseits von Theben&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Thebes is a game of competitive archeology.

Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&#10;&#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty?

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.&#10;&#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&#10;    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&#10;    Visit the opera and spend $2.&#10;    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&#10;    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&#10;&#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds.

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.&#10;&#10;In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.&#10;&#10;Here's the flavour text from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...&#10;&#10;&#10;The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.&#10;&#10;Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.&#10;&#10;Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa.

All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The in...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"length":6,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.93295,"weight":1.4773,"gameId":"113294","name":"Escape: The Curse of the Temple","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3328521_t.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playTime":10,"rank":406,"pollResultArray":[0.6568627450980392,0.8833333333333333,0.9829059829059829,1,0.9649122807017544],"pollValue":0.9829059829059829},{"designer":"Designers: Jay Cormier, Sen-Foong Lim","year":"2011","description":"Welcome to the Tasty Minstrel universe!

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.&#10;&#10;Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.&#10;&#10;Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.&#10;&#10;In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.&#10;&#10;Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors.

And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.&#10;&#10;This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:&#10;&#10;Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.&#10;&#10;A brief description from the rule book:&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India.&#10;&#10;Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. &#10;To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut.&#10;&#10;For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). &#10;The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn.&#10;&#10;Ships at landings that are &quot;complete&quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.&#10;&#10;During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters).&#10;Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.&#10;&#10;The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.&#10;&#10;Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them.&#10;&#10;This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters.&#10;Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players.&#10;&#10;Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points, and Manuel 1st (The King) will allow Players to take an additional Action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.&#10;&#10;The winner is the Player with the highest Victory Points score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships.

Characters and their actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.&#10;    Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can't participate in the dress rehearsals.&#10;    Set dresser: Build the set. The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive &mdash; but the set must be symmetrical!&#10;    Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need.

Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.&#10;&#10;On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you'll be able to do tomorrow &mdash; but those who don't plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.&#10;&#10;In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points.

The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).&#10;&#10;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on.

The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.&#10;&#10;The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.&#10;&#10;LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player.

Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.&#10;&#10;In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&#10;&#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&#10;&#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.&#10;&#10;With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.&#10;&#10;Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Send out the scouts!

The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you've collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Mars.

It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.&#10;&#10;The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8&quot; blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.&#10;&#10;The  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The  game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).&#10;&#10;You can win peacefully by:  &#10;&bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR &#10;&bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).&#10;&#10;If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:&#10;&bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three).&#10;&#10;Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.&#10;&#10;Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: &#10;&bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR &#10;&bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR &#10;&bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).&#10;&#10;Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.&#10;&#10;Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.&#10; The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: &#10;&bull; Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and &#10;&bull; Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with&#10;&bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),&#10;&bull; Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some&#10;&bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.&#10;&#10;If  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.&#10;&#10;At  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.&#10;&#10;Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.&#10;&#10;Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).&#10;&#10;Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a geopolitical strategy game for 3  players (also playable by 2) covering the competition for European supremacy during the period 1936-45 between Capitalism (the West), Communism (the Soviet  Union) and Fascism (the Axis).

This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.&#10;&#10;There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:&#10;&#10;    The Ottomans&#10;    The Habsburgs&#10;    The English&#10;    The French&#10;    The Papacy&#10;    The Protestants&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli published his masterpiece &quot;The Prince,&quot; backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.&#10;&#10;Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3&ndash;4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included.

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.&#10;&#10;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.&#10;&#10;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.&#10;&#10;To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.&#10;&#10;There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell &ndash; Wu-Feng &ndash; and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life....","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"length":5,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":7.2328,"weight":2.8963,"gameId":"37046","name":"Ghost Stories","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1790243_t.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playTime":60,"rank":180,"pollResultArray":[0.7916666666666666,0.8545454545454545,0.8173076923076923,0.9591836734693877],"pollValue":0.8173076923076923},{"designer":"Designer: Richard Sivél","year":"2004","description":"Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies!

The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.&#10;&#10;Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.&#10;&#10;The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is an historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).&#10;&#10;The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.&#10;&#10;Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game.

As a wealthy, well-educated aristocrat, you have travelled the world and had the fortune to enjoy your life to the fullest &ndash; but you see that history is about to change course and you know that in order to stay strong, your family must prepare well. You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...&#10;&#10;Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy enables you to build a powerful dynasty in 18th century France as you step into the shoes of a French noble and compete for lasting honor. Over three generations, you &ndash; a resourceful patriarch or matriarch &ndash; will attempt to create a lasting legacy by establishing a house with ties to many different wealthy and powerful families from France and abroad (Spain, Italy, Russia and other countries).&#10;&#10;This card game offers endless possibilities. Each time you build a family, you write a unique story, bringing to life the diverse relationships between parents and their children, between cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility &ndash; you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;In Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy &ndash; known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 &ndash; you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine &quot;contribution to the family&quot; cards. This all culminates in a highly thematic card game that will satisfy players who enjoy exploring many different paths to victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;Legacy is a worker placement game in which you take actions to improve the standing and/or wealth of your family. You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three 'currencies' in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as  marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).&#10;&#10;Prestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three 'currencies' detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.&#10;&#10;These currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!&#10;&#10;The card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"It is 1729 in pre-revolution France, a time when the aristocracy has all the power and the means to rule the country.

But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;&#10;Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards.

A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).&#10;&#10;&bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&#10;&#10;&bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault.

Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&#10;&#10;&bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.&#10;&#10;&bull; Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed.

Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. She then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.&#10;&#10;Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends. Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it. In the end, whoever has collected the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Cacao is a tile-placement game that immerses players in the exotic world of the &quot;fruit of the Gods&quot;.

The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&#10;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire&#10;    Thunderstone: Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands.

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut.

During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&#10;&#10;The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The mythical realm of Hyperborea was ruled by an ancient civilization that used magical crystals as their main source of energy.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island!

Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &quot;Setting&quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.  Dragonspire includes 18 new village cards, 11 new heroes, and 8 new monster sets.&#10;&#10;With enough cards to play the game right out of the box, this is a great Thunderstone edition for those just getting into the game.&#10;&#10;Dragonspire also has a new storage box format, plastic XP tokens, and a brand new Dungeon board to help players keep up with light and darkness.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone: Dragonspire is not a an expansion, but is instead a separate stand-alone game that may be played along with components of Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Dragon-Humanoid divider included with the game is meant for a future expansion as a promo.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion.

The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&#10;&#10;Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (odd numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&#10;&#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&#10;&#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&#10;&#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&#10;&#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.&#10;&#10;To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century.

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10;    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10;    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.  The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.

The game is build on two core concepts:&#10;&#10;1. Players bid for cards by building &quot;towers&quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &quot;below&quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.&#10;&#10;2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &quot;punishing&quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.&#10;&#10;The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn. In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources.&#10;&#10;---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----&#10;&#10;Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world.

Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that tpe you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game.

To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).&#10;&#10;Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.&#10;&#10;TWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices.&#10;&#10;The boardgame significantly broadens the original game&rsquo;s universe and emphasises the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.&#10;&#10;The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM: The Board Game is an INSTANT PLAY game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.&#10;&#10;Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war.&#10;&#10;In war, not everyone is a soldier.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.&#10;&#10;You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and con...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"length":7,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":7.01658,"weight":2.9326,"gameId":"188920","name":"This War of Mine: The Board Game","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3315915_t.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playTime":120,"rank":325,"pollResultArray":[0.9904761904761905,0.9431818181818182,0.8333333333333334,0.3333333333333333,0.07317073170731707,0.04878048780487805],"pollValue":0.8333333333333334},{"designer":"Designers: Nate French, Eric M. Lang","year":"2015","description":"In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle. In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.&#10;&#10;The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.&#10;&#10;The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle.

An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.&#10;&#10;Description&#10;&#10;In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).&#10;&#10;Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.&#10;&#10;Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.&#10;&#10;Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.&#10;&#10;&quot;Reimplements&quot;&#10;&#10;     StarCraft (video game)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Publisher blurb&#10;&#10;Including a total of 180 plastic figures and dozens of unit types, Starcraft: The Board Game features an innovative modular board of varying sizes, which guarantees a new experience each and every game.

Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Alternate Description of Quarriors&#10;&#10;In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Players take on the roles of Quarriors - mighty mystical warriors who have the power to capture dangerous quarry from the untamed Wilds!

The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.&#10;&#10;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&#10;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&#10;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&#10;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster!

The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.&#10;&#10;There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players &lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;HeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways.

One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet. Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards. As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe).&#10;&#10;Each animal has a distinct characteristic that players can use to their advantage. The turtle always moves one space, but it moves two if four of its cards were played. The rabbit always moves two spaces as long as cards are played. &mdash; unless four cards are played and it's at the head of the pack, in which case it sleeps and doesn't move. The fox moves as many spaces as the number of cards played. The lamb moves one more space than the number of cards played &mdash; but if it reaches water, it stops moving to take a drink. The wolf moves 1 space if one to two cards are played, and one less space than the number of cards if more are played.

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&#10;&#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&#10;&#10;In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&#10;&#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&#10;&#10;On your turn:&#10;&#10;     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &#10;     Then take one action:&#10;         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&#10;         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.&#10;         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&#10;         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed.

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;Components (according to the back of the box):&#10;&#10;     16 spell cards (in either English or French)&#10;     39 equipment cards (in either English or French)&#10;     60 tiles (actually 75, see below)&#10;     161 tokens&#10;     8 Hero sheets (one side in English, the other in French)&#10;     4 player aid sheets (one side in English, the other in French)&#10;     1 turn counter sheet (both sides in English)&#10;     1 Hero rule book (in either English or French)&#10;     1 Overlord rulebook (13 scenarios) (in either English or French)&#10;     2 map boards&#10;     15 dice&#10;     75 &quot;gems&quot; (blue and red)&#10;     25 coloured bases (5 each in red, orange, green, blue, purple)&#10;     106 miniatures (plastic)&#10;     1 Overlord board (plastic)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 13 come in English-French pairs, another 35 are in the edition's language (either French or English), and the remaining 14 tiles come in non-lingual pairs (two each of Khosatral Khel, Skuthus, Thak, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag, plus four Thog). The campaign book and adventure booklets use two tiles for Constantius, Khosatral Khel, Thog, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag. Conan: Nordheim includes a scenario that uses three Atali tiles. The non-lingual pairs (or the Thog quadruplet) are thus probably intended to be all used. This means a functional set of tiles is 62 strong, the remaining 13 tiles being set aside.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E.

Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies.&#10;    Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.&#10;    Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.&#10;    Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.&#10;    Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is no &quot;Alien player&quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.&#10;    Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.&#10;&#10;&#10;The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &quot;recalibrates&quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.&#10;&#10;The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.&#10;    The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.&#10;&#10;&#10;With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &quot;alien signals&quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.&#10;&#10;Official FAQ: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/faq.php&#10;Additional Missions: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/mission.php&#10;Galaxy Ball: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/gb-cards.php&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Galaxy Defenders is a sci-fi cooperative, tactical battle game in which 1-5 players fight together against an oncoming alien menace.

And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.&#10;&#10;Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars.

With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship!

Players will draft fuel cards in each round &ndash; picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible &ndash; giving you some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships. During a round, each player will play all of his fuel cards in the order of his choosing.

When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would!

Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent.

The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.&#10;&#10;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.&#10;    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.&#10;    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.&#10;    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.&#10;&#10;&#10;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.&#10;&#10;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game.

The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.&#10;&#10;In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.&#10;&#10;All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)&#10;&#10;If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.&#10;&#10;After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.&#10;&#10;Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution!

Lang","year":"2016","description":"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).&#10;&#10;The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.&#10;&#10;Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.&#10;&#10;The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.&#10;&#10;The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.&#10;&#10;There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.&#10;&#10;The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&#10;&#10;Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality.

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.&#10;&#10;The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.&#10;&#10;So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.&#10;&#10;These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar. It's shorter and lighter than many similar games, as well.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Havana you acquire victory points by constructing buildings, available as tiles displayed on the table.

The game board displays the six districts of Venice, and players earn VPs for placing council members into these, for building bridges and placing gondolas to connect the districts with one another, and for building advantageous buildings.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:&#10;&#10;1. Acquire cards: Each player takes a set of cards.&#10;2. Play cards: Players use cards to perform certain actions.&#10;3. Activate buildings: Players may take advantage of their buildings and use their powers.&#10;&#10;In phase 1, sets of eight cards are displayed (with six cards face-up and two face-down). Each player takes one set, then reduces his hand to seven cards. A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.&#10;     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.&#10;     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.&#10;&#10;Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&#10;     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Keltis entry:&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&#10;     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&#10;     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&#10;     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&#10;     All this is added to the points scored during the game&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Redevelopment of Lost Cities, first published with altered rules as Keltis, and then published by Rio Grande as Lost Cities: The Board Game with Knizia's original rules and theme.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reiner Knizia:  &quot;The original version that we ...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"length":5,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.47159,"weight":1.7471,"gameId":"42487","name":"Lost Cities: The Board Game","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2606157_t.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playTime":60,"rank":916,"pollResultArray":[0.08333333333333333,0.85,1,0.9523809523809523],"pollValue":1},{"designer":"Designer: Leo Colovini","year":"2000","description":"Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&#10;&#10;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&#10;&#10;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America.

Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.&#10;&#10;In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.&#10;&#10;In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone.

At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.&#10;&#10;Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies.

Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn. Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds. When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;For years the Marro have been summoned to Valhalla to expand the will of Utgar at all costs. But rumors are spreading that within the uncharted jungle there is an even greater menace waiting.

There are 2 new Terrain Types: Swamp &amp; Swamp Water, as well as more Grass, Sand, Rock, and Water tiles to add to your existing Heroscape battlefields.&#10;&#10;Also included in the set are 7 Unique Heroes, and 3 Common Marro Squads.

However, by late second century, court politics and poor governance has left it in rapid decline. The government was dominated by corrupt eunuchs and officials who levied heavy taxes on the peasants, resulting in public discontent. This culminated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling (168-189 AD).&#10;&#10;Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion was eventually put down, many surviving followers went on to become bandits and continued to create problems for the government. The Han army was unable to control the bandits and Emperor Ling granted direct administrative power over provinces and command of regional military to local lords. Many feudal lords took the opportunity to sever ties with the Han government and ruled independently. The more ambitious lords annexed neighboring territories to expand their power bases. This led to the emergence of the three power blocs of Wei, Wu and Shu, and ushered in the Three Kingdoms period.&#10;&#10;Three Kingdoms Redux is a board game that seeks to recreate the tripartite between the states of Wei, Wu and Shu. You assume the role of one of the three lords &ndash; Cao Cao leading Cao Wei, Sun Jian leading Eastern Wu or Liu Bei leading Shu Han. Players start the game from asymmetrical positions, reflecting the manpower advantages Wei enjoyed in the early part of the period. The weaker states of Wu and Shu protect themselves by forming an alliance. As a feudal lord, you manage the different aspects of running a state whilst guarding your borders against both rebellious border tribes and external enemies. Managing each aspect well earns victory points for your state. But beware, for the balance of power shifts constantly during the game.

You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&#10;&#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&#10;&#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&#10;&#10;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In The Staufer Dynasty, the players are nobles in the 12th century, accompanying Henry VI on his tour of the areas of Europe brought under control by the Staufer family, an area that included much of modern-day Germany, from the Baltic Sea in the nor...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"length":6,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.51041,"weight":3.0337,"gameId":"166226","name":"The Staufer Dynasty","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2256945_t.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playTime":90,"rank":857,"pollResultArray":[0,0.6818181818181818,0.9583333333333334,1,0.875],"pollValue":0.9583333333333334},{"designer":"Designers: Volko Ruhnke, Brian Train","year":"2013","description":"This volume in Volko Ruhnke's COIN Series takes 1 to 4 players into the Afghan conflict of today&rsquo;s headlines, this time in a unique collaboration between two top designers of boardgames on modern irregular warfare.

The players can expand the size of their water park and victory points can be earned in a number of ways. The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.&#10;&#10;The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play. Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.&#10;&#10;The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn. A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well.&#10;&#10;Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby. There are also coin options that allow a player to do a range of things.&#10;&#10;Aquaretto can be played as a stand alone game or used in conjunction with Zooloretto for a mega-game of sorts.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that Aquaretto is a slightly more involved experience than Zooloretto, with some more involved options, such as scoring bonuses for acquiring workers that interact with how many fish symbols a player has in their water park.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Aquaretto, the players are managing the planning and selection of animals for their water themed zoo, in the hope of acquiring the most victory points.

The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.&#10;&#10;While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design.

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&#10;&#10;Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency&#10;&#10;Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&#10;&#10;COIN Series, Volume II&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&mdash;both volumes share the same innovative GMT COIN Series system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&#10;&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&#10;&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&#10;&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&#10;&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&#10;&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?&#10;&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&#10;&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?&#10;&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&#10;&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&#10;&hellip; and much more.&#10;&#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&#10;&#10;&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&#10;&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  &#10;&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  &#10;&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.&#10;&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&#10;&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&#10;&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;More COIN Series Volumes to Come&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series).

Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.&#10;&#10;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.&#10;&#10;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors.

Other maneuvers or cards require a &quot;check&quot;, e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target.&#10;&#10;Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.&#10;&#10;Race! is a board game with no dice in which strategy and risk melt together to convey a truly intense and deep racing experience. Usually the winning player combines excellent management of his car together with a pinch of opportunism and bravery.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Race!

Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage!

(source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.

Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Maneuver Tool&#10;The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.&#10;&#10;It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.&#10;&#10;Command Stack&#10;Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.&#10;&#10;Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.&#10;&#10;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Massive Star Destroyers fly to battle against Rebel corvettes and frigates.

Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for we...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"length":5,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.68395,"weight":2.681,"gameId":"1634","name":"Warhammer Quest","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic355859_t.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playTime":120,"rank":633,"pollResultArray":[0.5217391304347826,0.7272727272727273,0.8260869565217391,1],"pollValue":0.8260869565217391},{"designer":"Designer: Bruno Faidutti","year":"2000","description":"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings.

Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents.

Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)&#10;&#10;The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game is a set collection game at its core. Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.&#10;&#10;Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.&#10;&#10;Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.&#10;&#10;Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.&#10;&#10;After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.&#10;&#10;If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).&#10;&#10;When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.&#10;&#10;After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.&#10;&#10;The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Traders of Carthage, players are merchants who are attempting to ship four different types of goods from Alexandria to Carthage.

Players then take actions in turn order, moving samurai on the board as needed (paying $1 per space moved) in order to complete actions (to the forest for wood, the rice fields for rice, cities to build, and so on). Before a player can move samurai, however, he must use an action to place them on the game board; some actions allow free movement, and others allow a player to recruit additional samurai beyond the initial five.&#10;&#10;One other action allows you to recruit additional action cards from an array on the side of the game board, thereby giving you four (or more) cards from which to choose for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Building in cities costs resources and gives you points as well as money; as more players build in a city, the funds are split among all present, with those first in the city receiving a larger share.

It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.&#10;&#10;Europe Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:&#10;&#10;Wood Block Units:&#10;Wood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war. Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged. The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.&#10;&#10;Production and Strategic Warfare:&#10;Europe Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.&#10;&#10;Special Actions:&#10;Special actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.&#10;&#10;Rulebook and Playbook:&#10;The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.

Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board.

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM.

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes.

True to the name of the German edition (a literal translation of which is &quot;Flying Sparks&quot;), it is time for Funkenschlag: Die ersten Funken, or &quot;The First Sparks&quot;.&#10;&#10;The First Sparks transports the Funkenschlag mechanisms into the Stone Age.

What is different?&#10;&#10;The First Sparks is much faster and far more direct. You are immediately part of the action. Each turn, each decision is important. As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.&#10;&#10;In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In 2001, 2F-Spiele published the original Funkenschlag.&#10;&#10;In 2011, it is time to look back...a long time back!

These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player. There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.&#10;&#10;Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent. He may take as many cards from his opponent as he has thrown Q's, keeping one and giving back the others.&#10;&#10;Kings: The player with the most K's becomes the new sheriff; he decides who wins in any ties, but the sheriff can be influenced with nuggets, cards, or money.&#10;&#10;Aces/Poker hand: In the town hall, the player with the best poker hand gets a property claim worth from one to five victory points.

The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.

The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.&#10;&#10;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.&#10;&#10;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions.

An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"A Study in Emerald is a game for two to five players based on the award-winning short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman.

The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). 'Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own 'Mechs from scratch. The base game (reprinted in many different editions) includes an introductory rulebook for new players; recent editions also include quick-start rules for an even faster orientation. The game is typically played on one or more mapsheets or (more recently) mounted map boards, and there are many mapsheet and &quot;hex&quot; (mounted-board) packs available for purchase or even download. Optional rules are also available for hexless play a la many miniatures games. An extensive line of pewter figurines ('Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available in the United States from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure lines in Europe.)&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of core rulebooks, the central one being Total Warfare (in print and PDF), which contains the main (tournament-legal) rules for the game. (The 2011 Catalyst reprint is up-to-date in terms of errata fixes.) TechManual (in print and PDF) contains construction rules for 'Mechs and other units. A series of three &quot;advanced rules&quot; books adds on to the standard rules: Tactical Operations (in print and PDF) covers on-planet actions over a period of hours; Strategic Operations (in print and PDF) covers in-system actions over a period of weeks; and Interstellar Operations (forthcoming; 2012?) covers system-level actions over a period of months. The final core rulebook available is A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (in print and PDF), a revised version of the BattleTech RPG rules, which have previously gone under the names MechWarrior and Classic BattleTech RPG. A one-volume tome on the BattleTech universe was announced years ago but has no scheduled release.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on 'Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history; map sets, including the new Hex Pack hard-mounted maps with tile overlays; sourcebooks; and pregenerated record sheets, as well as the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, the current generation includes an introductory box set.

Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&#10;&#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village!

It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.&#10;&#10;From Back of Box&#10;On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.&#10;&#10;To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.&#10;&#10;In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"(From the publisher)&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale.

Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards.

This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.

A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.&#10;&#10;A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame&#10; From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.

Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game a board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&#10;&#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining.

Moon","year":"1998","description":"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.

During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps. When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be &quot;pinning&quot; the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another. By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Diskwars has been updated to its new setting within the Warhammer world and features flexible rules for hero-centric army-building.

As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.&#10;&#10;As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal.

Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx.

A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.&#10;&#10;Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.&#10;&#10;Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) &#10;    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) &#10;    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry &#10;    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids&#10;    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French &#10;    French blockades to confound British plans&#10;    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort&#10;    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety &#10;    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:&#10;&#10;As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!&#10;&#10;As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.&#10;&#10;As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?&#10;&#10;As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.&#10;&#10;As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.

War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.&#10;&#10;In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.&#10;&#10;In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre! Balance gold and food, war and agriculture, territory and technology to forge an empire that is destined to rise above all other nations!&#10;&#10;Each copy of Rise of Empires contains:&#10;. 1 large game board&#10;. 1 tiles display&#10;. 40 resource discs&#10;. 150 player cubes in 5 colors&#10;. 45 action discs in 5 colors&#10;. 8 empire tiles&#10;. 40 territory tiles&#10;. 48 progress tiles&#10;. 36 city tiles&#10;. 104 gold markers&#10;. 5 alliance pieces&#10;. 5 player aid cards&#10;. 1 rules booklet with illustrated example of play.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"length":7,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.65378,"weight":1.7506,"gameId":"1465","name":"Wizard","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5948_t.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playTime":45,"rank":675,"pollResultArray":[0,0.08064516129032258,0.68,1,0.9879518072289156,0.9],"pollValue":0.68},{"designer":"Designers: Richard H.

It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander&rsquo;s empire.

Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.&#10;&#10;Successors was first published in 1995 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.&#10;&#10;In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved. Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules.

When you take control of a company you receive one share, which means that only one share per turn can be purchased. The cubes you bid with go into the company and allow it to build track. Each location has a value which determines how much profit you receive for connecting it. After companies have built as much track as they can players are paid the profit that each company they control has made this turn. Profit levels are reset for the following turn.

You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.&#10;&#10;The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.&#10;&#10;After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.&#10;&#10;It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions.

There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.&#10;&#10;The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.&#10;&#10;Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Watson &amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &#10;Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&ntilde;ar&aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&oacute;n de una serie de casos in&eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&oacute;n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber&aacute; sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra&iacute;das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l&oacute;gica deductiva.&#10;&#10;Y, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu&eacute;l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar&aacute; la confianza del genio de Baker Street.&#10;&#10;El juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu&aacute;les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar&aacute; de resolver antes que los dem&aacute;s.&#10;Para ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder&aacute;n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci&oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.&#10;Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes.

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.&#10;&#10;In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.&#10;&#10;After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.&#10;&#10;Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.&#10;&#10;Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The 2012 rerelease of Wallenstein tweaks the 2002 title from designer Dirk Henn and publisher Queen Games, while including two new expansions.&#10;&#10;The setting and game play of the two games are mostly the same.

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too.

The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?&#10;&#10;In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.&#10;&#10;Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.&#10;&#10;In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.&#10;&#10;The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The Kingdom is in chaos.

The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&#10;&#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&#10;&#10;Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&#10;&#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&#10;&#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&#10;&#10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &quot;pirate&quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Come aboard and sail to Pirate's Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers.

That player is out of the game, and the remaining player who has the most VP on their Industry wins.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Based on the textbook example of financial scams, &quot;Ponzi Scheme&quot; is the term used to describe the technique Charles Ponzi employed in 1919 to operate one of the most notorious financial fraud in history.&#10;&#10;In the game Ponzi Scheme, p...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"length":6,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.43544,"weight":2.6061,"gameId":"180899","name":"Ponzi Scheme","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3894290_t.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playTime":90,"rank":969,"pollResultArray":[0,0,0.6666666666666666,1,0.9333333333333333],"pollValue":0.6666666666666666},{"designer":"Designers: Rob Daviau, Chris Dupuis","year":"2011","description":"This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game. Details on why this is important in the description.&#10;&#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&#10;&#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&#10;&#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&#10;&#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique, and plays better than any other version of Risk.&#10;&#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game.

Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Two Lancastrians and two Yorkists draft cards that give them control of major towns, nobles, bishops and royal castles.

The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.&#10;&#10;The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:&#10;&#10;Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).&#10;Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)&#10;Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).&#10;Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). &#10;Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)&#10;Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).&#10;Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).&#10;One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).&#10;High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).&#10;&#10;Poker has many variants.  The two main forms of Poker are: Stud Poker and Draw Poker.&#10;&#10;In Draw Poker, all cards are dealt face down to each player.  One of the most played  versions of Draw Poker is Five (5) card Draw Poker (often shown in TV and Motion Pictures).  Each player is dealt five (5) cards.  There is a betting interval, and those left in the deal, may trade cards in their hand for new cards from the stock (IE: Discard two cards, and receive two new cards from the dealer).  There is then a final betting interval before the showdown.&#10;&#10;In Stud Poker, some of the cards are dealt face down, and some are exposed for all players to see.  One of the most common games of Stud Poker is Seven (7) card Stud Poker.  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  After the first betting interval, each remaining player is dealt another card face up.  This continues two more times, with a betting interval before each deal, until all players that remain have two cards face down, and four cards face up.  Each player then receives a final card face down, and there is a final betting interval before the showdown.&#10;&#10;Currently, one of the most popular versions of Poker is a version of Stud Poker called Texas Hold'Em.&#10;&#10;No-Limit Texas Hold'Em is the version used in The World Series of Poker each year.  Each player is dealt two cards face down.  After a betting interval, three community cards are dealt face up at the same time.  There is another betting interval, and another community card is dealt face up; after another betting interval, another community card is dealt face up.  There is then another betting interval before the showdown.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Poker is played with a standard deck of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards.

Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points.

The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! &ndash; Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.&#10;&#10;Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.&#10;&#10;The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Conflict of Heroes is a fast-paced tactical board game series that follows the development of modern day squad and platoon level tactics, starting with World War II and continuing all the way through modern day Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.&#10;&#10;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:&#10;&#10;* 1 Rulebook&#10;    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions&#10;    * 4 Capital Boards&#10;    * 35 Resource Tokens&#10;    * 60 Damage Tokens&#10;    * 4 Burning Tokens&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Battle Pack Expansion Cycles:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        &#10;1) The Corruption Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Skavenblight Threat&#10;    Path of the Zealot&#10;    Tooth and Claw&#10;    The Deathmaster's Dance&#10;    The Warpstone Chronicles&#10;    Arcane Fire&#10;&#10;&#10;2) The Enemy Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Burning of Derricksburg&#10;    The Fall of Karak Grimaz&#10;    The Silent Forge&#10;    Redemption of a Mage&#10;    The Fourth Waystone&#10;    Bleeding Sun&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;3) The Morrslieb Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Omens of Ruin&#10;    The Chaos Moon&#10;    The Twin Tailed Comet&#10;    Signs in the Stars&#10;    The Eclipse of Hope&#10;    Fiery Dawn&#10;&#10;&#10;4) The Capital Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Inevitable City&#10;    Realm of the Phoenix King&#10;    The Iron Rock&#10;    Karaz-a-Karak&#10;    City of Winter&#10;    The Imperial Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;5) The Bloodquest Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Rising Dawn&#10;    Fragments of Power&#10;    The Accursed Dead&#10;    Vessel of the Winds&#10;    Portent of Doom&#10;    Shield of the Gods&#10;&#10;&#10;6) The Eternal War Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Days of Blood&#10;    Oaths of Vengeance&#10;    Battle for the Old World&#10;    Glory of Days Past&#10;    The Ruinous Hordes&#10;    Faith and Steel          &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;7) Deluxe Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Assault on Ulthuan&#10;    March of the Damned&#10;    Legends&#10;    Cataclysm&#10;    Hidden Kingdoms&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing.

Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!&#10;&#10;Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.&#10;&#10;Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!&#10;&#10;The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they 'Bots, 'Borgs or Naturals!&#10;&#10;Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV&nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!&#10;&#10;The contents of Baseball Highlights: 2045 box is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;4 stadium mats&#10;4 reference sheets&#10;&#10;120 cards:&#10;&#10;     60 starter cards&#10;     60 free agent cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;60 wooden pawns:&#10;&#10;     20 red&#10;     20 white&#10;     20 blue&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;12 cardboard markers:&#10;&#10;     4 triangular markers (visitor/home)&#10;     8 circular markers&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"American baseball was on its last legs as a spectator sport.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.&#10;&#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  ...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"length":7,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.74996,"weight":2.7824,"gameId":"224","name":"History of the World","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic287451_t.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playTime":180,"rank":582,"pollResultArray":[0.07017543859649122,0.13846153846153847,0.4057971014492754,0.8354430379746836,1,0.9651162790697675],"pollValue":0.4057971014492754},{"designer":"Designers: Ted Alspach, Akihisa Okui","year":"2014","description":"No moderator, no elimination, ten-minute games.&#10;&#10;One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability.

Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race&rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;Each Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;But the war doesn&rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.&#10;&#10;Note: This entry in the BGG database is used to consolidate questions and discussion regarding the Summoner Wars series; it does not correspond to a particular box or deck of the Summoner Wars game.

Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.&#10;&#10;The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"As the Chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe; Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa, or Tamang, you lead your yak's caravan from one village to another through snowy crests and risky paths in order to collect the goods necessary to the development of your tribe...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"length":5,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.49673,"weight":2.5727,"gameId":"3800","name":"Himalaya","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1205729_t.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playTime":60,"rank":873,"pollResultArray":[0,0.11538461538461539,0.475,1],"pollValue":0.475},{"designer":"Designers: Mike Elliott, Eric M.

The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts the advance abandoned with the stunned demise or their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat of been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire against your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armour assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armoured advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows you own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design You Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters or real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles of 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armoured warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!

In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs.&#10;&#10;Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set! This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe. The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign. This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War.&#10;&#10;The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!&#10;&#10;You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:&#10;A-10A Thunderbolt II&#10;A-10C Thunderbolt II&#10;AH-64A Apache&#10;AH-64D Apache Longbow&#10;AV-8B Harrier II&#10;AH-1 Cobra&#10;RQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;MQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;AC-130 Spectre&#10;&#10;Scheduled Campaigns:&#10;Iraq 1991&#10;Pakistan 2013&#10;Libya 1984&#10;Iran 2014&#10;Taiwan Defense 2008&#10;North Korea 2011&#10;Israel Defense 2001&#10;North Atlantic WWIII 1986&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye&#10;&#10;Target Audience: &#10;This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.&#10;&#10;Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you in the cockpits of the world&rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft.

Scott Johnson","year":"1994","description":"Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.&#10;&#10;VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.&#10;&#10;VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.&#10;&#10;Although the last official card set was released in 2010 by White Wolf, VTES is still played and enjoyed by players around the world. Tournaments still draw large groups of attendees, and some continental championships see more than 100 players attend. The game is currently supported by Vampire: Elder Kindred Network&trade;, the official player organization responsible for sanctioning and regulating VTES tournaments, recording V:TES players&rsquo; ratings (and rankings), as well as designing and releasing new digital expansions featuring profession artwork.

Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.&#10;&#10;The six powers in Virgin Queen are:&#10;&#10;     Ottoman&#10;     Spain&#10;     England&#10;     France&#10;     Holy Roman Empire&#10;     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.&#10;     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.&#10;     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.&#10;     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?&#10;     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?&#10;     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:&#10;&#10;     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.&#10;     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.&#10;     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play. Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"from GMT website:&#10;&#10;Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"length":7,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.88903,"weight":4.3714,"gameId":"41066","name":"Virgin Queen","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1276971_t.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playTime":420,"rank":445,"pollResultArray":[0.034482758620689655,0.20689655172413793,0.2903225806451613,0.7435897435897436,0.8292682926829268,0.9622641509433962],"pollValue":0.2903225806451613},{"designer":"Designer: A.

Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).&#10;&#10;Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.&#10;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.&#10;&#10;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.&#10;&#10;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.&#10;&#10;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the &quot;Prime Universe&quot; of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Ex...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"length":5,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.95896,"weight":3.0502,"gameId":"79127","name":"Star Trek: Fleet Captains","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1081488_t.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playTime":75,"rank":376,"pollResultArray":[0.125,1,0.25806451612903225,0.8775510204081632],"pollValue":0.25806451612903225},{"designer":"Designer: Jean-Louis Roubira","year":"2011","description":"Dixit Odyssey is both a standalone game and an expansion (Dixit Odyssey (expansion)) for Jean-Louis Roubira's Dixit, which won Germany's Spiel des Jahres award in 2010.&#10;&#10;Game play in Dixit Odyssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller.

Players need not be familiar with any of the various SQUAD LEADER games or rules to play. The basic theory behind the design remains the same; only the mechanics of play differ. UP FRONT is a far simpler adaptation of SQUAD LEADER principles designed to a card game format. Yet, in many ways, the game is more realistic than its predecessor in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, its famous predecessor, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.&#10;&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).&#10;&#10;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Each game includes: &#10;&#10;     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards&#10;     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards&#10;     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards&#10;     304 double-faced .75&quot;, .6&quot;, and .5&quot; counters&#10;     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each&#10;     A plastic card tray&#10;     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Historical T, O &amp; E charts and Campaign Game Rosters.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design.

Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.

A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards).

Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution.

It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories.

In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.&#10;&#10;The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world.&#10;&#10;A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.&#10;&#10;One of the major appeals of the Living Card Game&reg; format is that it gives you not only a solid game experience, full of strategy and excitement, but it also allows you to customize your gaming experience to your liking. As you customize your deck from the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game card pool, you get to build a strategy around your personal play style.&#10;&#10;This game was originally a CCG, having been transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Monthly Asylum Pack expansions to the card pool were eventually supplanted by larger quarterly(-ish) expansion boxes.&#10;&#10;FFG ended development and organized play support for the game in 2015. &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even death may die.&quot;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"&quot;The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.&uml;&#10;- H.P.

Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.&#10;&#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance.

Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.&#10;&#10;The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects. The Rebels win by destroying three dark side objectives before the Empire wins.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"It is a dark time for the galaxy.

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal & Hamilcar.

Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.&#10;&#10;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him?

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.&#10;&#10;&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"From the author:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals.

Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.&#10;&#10;To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:&#10;&#10;        No dice are used&#10;        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.&#10;        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.&#10;        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.&#10;&#10;No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.&#10;&#10;Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.&#10;&#10;True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     2 weeks per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     Point to point&#10;UNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     2&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    Mounted Map&#10;    119 wooden pieces&#10;    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets&#10;    110 cards&#10;    Rulebook&#10;    Two player aid cards&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Matthew Calkins&#10;MAP &amp; BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"length":3,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":7.32048,"weight":2.7316,"gameId":"25021","name":"Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063508_t.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playTime":180,"rank":140,"pollResultArray":[0.07142857142857142,1],"pollValue":0},{"designer":"Designer: Andreas Steiger","year":"2012","description":"Theme and overview:&#10;&#10;Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round there new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Theme and overview:&#10;&#10;Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils.

The economies, after decades of central planning and stagnation, have reached various stages of crisis.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &quot;couples&quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&#10;&#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series.

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.&#10;&#10;The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925,when he introduced an improved method of scoring.&#10;&#10;The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&#10;&#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.'

It wasn&rsquo;t.&#10;&#10;In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks on US targets in East Africa in 1998 and the Arab Peninsula in 2000.&#10;&#10;Bin Ladin&rsquo;s al-Qaeda organization plotted securely under the protection of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan born of the anti-Soviet &ldquo;Bear Trap&rdquo; of the 1980s. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes &mdash; this time within the US Homeland &mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT&rsquo;s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists&rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle &mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.&#10;&#10;From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and later Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake, Labyrinth combines an emphasis on game play with multifaceted simulation spanning recent history and near future. In the 2-player game, one player takes the role of jihadists seeking to exploit world events and Islamic donations to spread fundamentalist rule over the Muslim world. The other player as the United States must neutralize terrorist cells while encouraging Muslim democratic reform to cut off extremism at its roots. With the game&rsquo;s solitaire system, a single player as the US takes on ascending levels of challenge in defeating al-Qaeda and its allies.&#10;&#10;The jihadists must operate in a hostile environment &mdash; staying below the authorities&rsquo; radar while plotting terrorist attacks and building for the Muslim revolution. Will Iran&rsquo;s Shia mullahs help or hinder the Sunni jihadists? Will the gradual spread of Islamist rule bring final victory &mdash; or will it be a sudden strike at the United States with an Islamic weapon of mass destruction?&#10;&#10;The United States has the full weight of its military force and diplomacy at the ready &mdash; but it can&rsquo;t be everywhere: will technological and material superiority be enough? US forces can invade and topple Islamist regimes, but how will the Muslim &ldquo;street&rdquo; react? And if quagmire results, how will the US find its way out?&#10;&#10;Labyrinth features distinct operational options for each side that capture the asymmetrical nature of the conflict, while the event cards that drive its action pose a maze of political, religious, military, and economic issues. In the parallel wars of bombs and ideas, coordinated international effort is key &mdash; but terrorist opportunities to disrupt Western unity are many. The Towers have fallen, but the global struggle has only just begun.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s roll!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"2001: The &ldquo;American Century&rdquo; had closed with a single Cold War superpower standing and a pause in conflict that some at the time dubbed &ldquo;The End of History&rdquo;.

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.&#10;&#10;In the game, players represent one of the seven &quot;Great Powers of Europe&quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.&#10;&#10;The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886.

To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.&#10;&#10;In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&rsquo;s endless supply of gold.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros is played over one of several included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&rsquo;t), the sight of your army&rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros!

Petersen","year":"2012","description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&#10;&#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&#10;&#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&#10;&#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&#10;&#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of gr...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"length":7,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.73979,"weight":3.2578,"gameId":"104363","name":"Rex: Final Days of an Empire","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1246187_t.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playTime":120,"rank":589,"pollResultArray":[0.03508771929824561,0.047619047619047616,0.07246376811594203,0.7397260273972602,0.84,0.9886363636363636],"pollValue":0.07246376811594203},{"designer":"Designer: Kota Nakayama","year":"2013","description":"Welcome to the most well-known geisha street in the old capital, Hanamikoji.

You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.&#10;&#10;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau.

While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include:&#10;&#10;Banzai attacks;&#10;BARs and Thompson SMGs;&#10;Beach landings &amp; river crossings;&#10;Hidden movement;&#10;Caves;&#10;Scouts;&#10;Aircraft;&#10;Bayonets;&#10;Mortar spotting;&#10;Treetop snipers;&#10;Reconnoitering.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Turn abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete Game Turn abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;UNITS: Due in part to the unique composition of late-war USMC squads and the imbedding of specialized weapon teams within IJA squads, the units in the game are represented by 4-6 man Teams and 8-13 man Squads. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a rifle &mdash; are represented by their own counters. Individual Aircraft are also represented with their own counters.&#10;&#10;VICTORY: Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments.

Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.&#10;&#10;The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition.

In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...&#10;&#10;Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.&#10;&#10;&#10;Apart from these three from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box.

In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table.

EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.&#10;&#10;As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.&#10;&#10;Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.&#10;&#10;The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.&#10;EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman&#10;DEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg&#10;MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, &amp; Rodger B. MacGowan&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.&#10;&#10;The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.&#10;&#10;As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.&#10;&#10;Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.&#10;&#10;Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.&#10;&#10;Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People.

It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).&#10;&#10;Yomi is the Japanese word for &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.&#10;&#10;Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &quot;just random,&quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Yomi (second edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game.

An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.&#10;&#10;Ways to Play:&#10;The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.

Each player leads their own civilization as it tries to expand its culture over a map board that stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to India.&#10; Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Mega Civilization is not a wargame as you might expect when looking at the map board. Instead, the objective of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, scientific, political, civic, and religious factors. The player who most effectively balances these various goals will achieve the best scores and win.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the objective of Mega Civilization is to acquire the highest number of victory points (VPs) by building cities and developing Civilization Advances. This will be done over various phases and turns, some of which will be performed simultaneously by the players. After each turn, a check is made for each player to move forward on the Archaeological Succession Table (A.S.T.). Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age. Advancement there will provide even more VPs. The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T. or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner.&#10;&#10;Each civilization begins with a single population token, and every turn each player increases their population by adding tokens to each area they occupy. These tokens can be moved over the map board by land or (using ships) by sea. As each area has a population limit, a good strategic overview will give players advantage in occupying more and more areas. If a player manages to move sufficient tokens into an area, they can build a city there. These cities generate trade cards which will eventually lead to wealth. During trade sessions, players receive not only the commodities they need to complete sets; they might also receive calamities which will remove population or cities. Specific Civilization Advances will protect the players from natural or civic calamities. The development of these Civilization Advances is symbolized by turning in sets of trading goods, as the wealthier civilizations will acquire more Civilization Advances.&#10;&#10;As civilizations develop, it will be harder for their rulers to find the right balance between future population growth, maintaining enough support for their cities, and increasing their treasury. If they cannot manage their token population, their cities might eventually revolt during the tax collection phase. The civilizations with the strongest economy traditionally score the highest.&#10;&#10;A game of Mega Civilization can take 10-12 hours to complete. Players can also choose to play the beginner scenario &mdash; &quot;The First Game&quot; &mdash; which takes only 1-2 hours. Another scenario &mdash; &quot;The Short Game&quot; &mdash; provides the same excitement as the full game, although the game starts in a later age; by doing this, games can be played in &quot;only&quot; 6-8 hours.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Mega Civilization, a huge version of the legendary development game Civilization, is a game of skill for 5 to 18 players covering the historical development of ancient civilizations from just after the last Ic...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"7":{},"8":{},"9":{},"10":{},"11":{},"12":{},"13":{},"14":{},"15":{},"16":{},"17":{},"18":{},"length":19,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":6.53409,"weight":3.7619,"gameId":"184424","name":"Mega Civilization","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2688180_t.jpg","minPlayers":5,"maxPlayers":18,"playTime":720,"rank":819,"pollResultArray":[0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.16666666666666666,0.8518518518518519,0.96,1,0.9615384615384616,0.9642857142857143,0.9090909090909091,0.8181818181818182,0.8181818181818182,0.782608695652174,0.782608695652174,0.7619047619047619,0.7619047619047619,0.7142857142857143,0.7142857142857143],"pollValue":0.045454545454545456},{"designer":"Designer: Dominique Bodin","year":"2014","description":"Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P.

Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.&#10;&#10;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.&#10;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.&#10;&#10;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules overview from the official rules:&#10;&#10;The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight.&#10;During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas.&#10;Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total&#10;power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do&#10;this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of&#10;dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up&#10;discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with&#10;dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals).&#10;A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos.

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements.

The above write up is mistaken when it states that &quot;For The People&quot; is based on &quot;Hannibal v Rome&quot;, but was my second game in the &quot;We The People&quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;UPDATE:&#10;The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released.

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations.

How they do so? Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash.&#10;&#10;Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market. Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects. To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse. Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used. This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse. They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses. Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so. When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds. But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value!

Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives.

Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.

In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France.

In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof.

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game.

(One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico.

Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.

The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take one resource of your choice and two camels.

You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been removed.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution.

Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers.

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Official FAQ&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Expansions were published in this order:&#10;&#10;Asylum (base game) (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition &#226;&#128;&#147; Endurance (2017) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)&#10;&#10;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe.

Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring.

The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways.

Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network.

New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where.

As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).&#10;&#10;During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost &ndash; and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis.

If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action.

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order that allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.

Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend.

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world.

It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Factions&#10;&#10;Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Trade Federation&#10;&#10;In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Blobs&#10;&#10;These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Star Empire&#10;&#10;The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Machine Cult&#10;&#10;A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Playing Star Realms&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).&#10;&#10;Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat.

Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from 'Puerto Rico' to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of 'Settlers of Catan', while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of 'Attack' to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power.

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&#10;&#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&#10;&#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&#10;&#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.&#10;&#10;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses o...","playerPollResults":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"5":{},"6":{},"length":7,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}}},"bayesAve":7.51322,"weight":3.6627,"gameId":"103343","name":"A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077906_t.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playTime":240,"rank":76,"pollResultArray":[0.009876543209876543,0.014527845036319613,0.32571428571428573,0.5730337078651685,0.8083182640144665,0.9910044977511244],"pollValue":0.32571428571428573},{"designer":"Designer: (Uncredited)","year":"1876","description":"This game is like shuffleboard in the round.

Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle.

Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Components (original edition):&#10;&#10;&#10;     228 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map &#10;     103 event cards &#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&#10;&#10;     260 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     110 event cards&#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&#10;&#10;     Mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&#10;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&#10;     Revised rules and player aid cards&#10;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Map with revised graphics&#10;     New card decks&#10;     Updated Rules &amp; Charts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","shortDescription":"&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;&#10;&ndash; John F.

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs.

Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.

These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters).
